# 100 Days Of Code - Beth's Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2020

**Intentions**: Prioritize what all I need to work on to update portfolio and to move my projects to AWS.

**Skills I would like to strengthen**:
    React, Express, Swift, MongoDB, SwiftUI, SASS

**Would like to learn**:
    Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, UI/UX Design, Figma

**Today's Progress**: Setup training calendar. Identified areas I want to work on.

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to tackle this challenge & see where I'm at in 100 days!

### Day 1: August 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: My plan is to work on an old project that is currently broke due to npm issues.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with time management today.  Due to 'Life' occurring... my coding schedule was majorly interupted.  I did get to do some peer coding with the Dev group for a project I'm currently working on.  We were working on setting up the MongoDB User Schema.

### Day 2: August 20, 2020

**Working On**: I've recently started learning how to link AWS to GitHub & Docker.  

**Today's Progress**: Got GitHub > Docker > AWS to work once & then kept on getting errors.  So spent the night trying to debug.  Will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: AWS is interesting & very complex.  I need to know more about Docker to see if I'm having errors there.

### Day 3: August 21, 2020

**Working On**: Continued working on getting the bugs revolved between AWS to GitHub & Docker.  

**Today's Progress**: Feel like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.  Thinking I need to incorpate a CI inbetween GitHub & Docker/AWS.  Will look into that tomorrow.

**Thoughts** More confused than ever regarding the error I'm getting.  Think I'll check out Stephen Grinder's Udemy course tomorrow to see if that helps.

### Day 4: August 22, 2020

**Working On**: Stephen Grinder's Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy.    

**Today's Progress**: Got thru 1/4 of the course. Created a simple Node app as part of the course & connected it to Docker.

**Thoughts**: Have a much better understanding of Docker & how containers & images work.

### Day 5: August 23, 2020

**Working On**: Stephen Grinder's Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy.    

**Today's Progress**: 45% of the course done. Created a simple React app that was connected to Docker & deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The app used Travis CI to test & monitor the master GitHub branch before deploying to AWS.

**Thoughts**: I didn't get as much done today.  It was great to be able to create the full workflow.  Taking the project from basic React app to GitHub repo, then linking it to Docker. Followed by setting up Travis CI and the deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I look forward to the next Section where I'll be building a Multi-Container app.

### Day 6: August 24, 2020

**Working On**: Stephen Grider's Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy.    

**Today's Progress**: 55% complete with the course & only have the deployment left of the multi-container docker app left to do tomorrow.  

**Thoughts**: Have a much better understanding of Docker containers & setting up the workflow between GitHub, Travis CI, and Docker.  Wanted to get the deployment done today, but my brain is fried.  So time to send the evening with Yogi Bear.

### Day 7: August 25, 2020

**Working On**: Stephen Grider's Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy & Prentus Group 2 Project.  

**Today's Progress**: I didn't got thru more of the course, but I spent time explaining some of what I've learned in the course with a couple of Prentus teammates & how we can improve the project we are currently working on.

### Day 8: August 26, 2020

**Working On**: iPad issues.  Did some tutoritals on Swift Playground while waiting for tech support.   

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get thru much today due to device issues.  Spent most of the day working w/ Apple Support to address this issue.  

**Thoughts**: 

**Code**: 

### Day 9: August 27, 2020

**Working On**: Ordered new iPad. Worked some on Stephen Grider's Docker & Kubernetes course. 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Mark on refactoring Docker code for best practices.

**Thoughts**: It was great being about to walk thru the Docker code & understanding what we are doing & why.  I was able to share some of what I had learned to help make the Docker code more complete.

### Day 10: August 28, 2020

**Working On**: Worked some on Stephen Grider's Docker & Kubernetes course. 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up Dockerrun.aws.json. Taking baby steps to getting setup on AWS. Had a team meeting for Prentus project, was able to get some tasked assigned out & some brainstorming done.

**Thoughts**: My brain is feeling a little fried, so I've made the decision to take the weekend off.  Need to rest & recop.

### Day 12: August 30, 2020

**Working On**: Played some with Swift Playground  

**Today's Progress**: Got thru the Commands section & started the Functions section.

**Thoughts**: Swift Playground is a great refresher.  I have been working mainly on Full Stack Dev for the last few weeks, so it was fun to do the refresher.

**Code**: 

### Day 13: August 31, 2020

**Working On**: Stephen Grinder's Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy.    

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Docker portion of the course. 

**Thoughts**: Interesting to setup the project on AWS Elastic Beanstalk used ElastiCache, Regional Database Services(RDS), Scalable Storage(S3), and IAM for the project.

### Day 14: September 1, 2020

**Working On**: JavaScript30 - vanilla JS, Prentus project - testing   

**Today's Progress**: JS computer Drum Kit in vanilla JS. Prentus team/Dev meeting - testing.

**Thoughts**: I made a computer Drum Kit. I've made one before but not with vanilla JS. Started day 1 of JavaScript 30 to help strengthen my basic JS skills. I also meet with my Prentus team, the Devs had a great discussion about testing & wrote some peer test code for our DB. We decided to use TDD for testing, so this is new to most of us & will be a great learning experience!

### Day 15: September 2, 2020

**Working On**:    Swift Playground

**Today's Progress**: Got thru 3 lessons

**Thoughts**: Was a crazy day of appointments (hair & vet), so I didn't get to code much on my MacBook, but found that Swift Playground is great to use on my iPad while waiting at appointments.  The short lessons are fun yet make you think.  Most importantly, the reactions from others are great when they ask what game you are playing & you explain you are writing the code to run the scene. It results in some great questions & comments!

### Day 16: September 3, 2020

**Working On**:    JS30 - CSS + JS Clock, Cooking the Code - setup 7-1 SASS Architecture 

**Today's Progress**: Today I made a CSS + JS Clock using vanilla JS as part of JS30. I also setup the SASS 7-1 architecture for our Prentus project. Wrote some example SASS for some of the files that we can use as a template as we get design elements from the Designer. Tested on localhost to make sure SASS was connecting & responding properly. Setup folder structure for React portion of project.  Wrote README.md files for SASS & ui/src folders.

Started JS challenges on Edabit.com - worked thru 3 challenges while hanging out with Yogi.

**Thoughts**: Was a productive day.  Really enjoyed the JS30 clock exercise. Feeling good about the work done on the Prentus Project.

### Day 18: September 5, 2020

**Working On**:  Edabit.com challenges - 5 challenges, Prentus Project - convert CSS variables to SASS variables, add template for Dockerrun.aws.json file, added Apple OAuth2.0 script to index.html & started setting up project on Apple Developer Portal.  

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the @Prentus project I'm the PM for, converting CSS variables into SASS variables and added a template for the Dockerrun.aws.json file. We are planning to incorporate a few OAuth2.0 options for register/login, so I started the setup to add Sign in with Apple to the project by adding the required script to the index.html file & setting up the project on Apple Developer Portal. I also Completed 3 @Edabit JS challenges. 

**Thoughts**: Can't complete the Apple OAuth until we have a domain setup for the project.
