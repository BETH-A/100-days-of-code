### Day 1: August 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: My plan is to work on an old project that is currently broke due to npm issues.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with time management today.  Due to 'Life' occurring... my coding schedule was majorly interupted.  I did get to do some peer coding with the Dev group for a project I'm currently working on.  We were working on setting up the MongoDB User Schema.

### Day 2: August 20, 2020

**Working On**: I've recently started learning how to link AWS to GitHub & Docker.  

**Today's Progress**: Got GitHub > Docker > AWS to work once & then kept on getting errors.  So spent the night trying to debug.  Will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: AWS is interesting & very complex.  I need to know more about Docker to see if I'm having errors there.

### Day 3: August 21, 2020

**Working On**: Continued working on getting the bugs revolved between AWS to GitHub & Docker.  

**Today's Progress**: Feel like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.  Thinking I need to incorpate a CI inbetween GitHub & Docker/AWS.  Will look into that tomorrow.

**Thoughts** More confused than ever regarding the error I'm getting.  Think I'll check out Stephen Grinder's Udemy course tomorrow to see if that helps.

### Day 4: August 22, 2020

**Working On**: Stephen Grinder's Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy.    

**Today's Progress**: Got thru 1/4 of the course. Created a simple Node app as part of the course & connected it to Docker.

**Thoughts**: Have a much better understanding of Docker & how containers & images work.

### Day 5: August 23, 2020

**Working On**: Stephen Grinder's Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy.    

**Today's Progress**: 45% of the course done. Created a simple React app that was connected to Docker & deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The app used Travis CI to test & monitor the master GitHub branch before deploying to AWS.

**Thoughts**: I didn't get as much done today.  It was great to be able to create the full workflow.  Taking the project from basic React app to GitHub repo, then linking it to Docker. Followed by setting up Travis CI and the deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I look forward to the next Section where I'll be building a Multi-Container app.

### Day 14: September 1, 2020

**Working On**: JavaScript30 - vanilla JS, Prentus project - testing   

**Today's Progress**: JS computer Drum Kit in vanilla JS. Prentus team/Dev meeting - testing.

**Thoughts**: I made a computer Drum Kit. I've made one before but not with vanilla JS. Started day 1 of JavaScript 30 to help strengthen my basic JS skills. I also meet with my Prentus team, the Devs had a great discussion about testing & wrote some peer test code for our DB. We decided to use TDD for testing, so this is new to most of us & will be a great learning experience!

### Day 15: September 2, 2020

**Working On**:    Swift Playground

**Today's Progress**: Got thru 3 lessons

**Thoughts**: Was a crazy day of appointments (hair & vet), so I didn't get to code much on my MacBook, but found that Swift Playground is great to use on my iPad while waiting at appointments.  The short lessons are fun yet make you think.  Most importantly, the reactions from others are great when they ask what game you are playing & you explain you are writing the code to run the scene. It results in some great questions & comments!  

**Code**: Repo - 

### Day 16: September 3, 2020

**Working On**:    JS30 - CSS + JS Clock, Cooking the Code - setup 7-1 SASS Architecture 

**Today's Progress**: Today I made a CSS + JS Clock using vanilla JS as part of JS30. I also setup the SASS 7-1 architecture for our Prentus project. Wrote some example SASS for some of the files that we can use as a template as we get design elements from the Designer. Tested on localhost to make sure SASS was connecting & responding properly. Setup folder structure for React portion of project.  Wrote README.md files for SASS & ui/src folders.

Started JS challenges on Edabit.com - worked thru 3 challenges while hanging out with Yogi.

**Thoughts**: Was a productive day.  Really enjoyed the JS30 clock exercise. Feeling good about the work done on the Prentus Project.

### Day 18: September 5, 2020

**Working On**:  Edabit.com challenges - 5 challenges, Prentus Project - convert CSS variables to SASS variables, add template for Dockerrun.aws.json file, added Apple OAuth2.0 script to index.html & started setting up project on Apple Developer Portal.  

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the @Prentus project I'm the PM for, converting CSS variables into SASS variables and added a template for the Dockerrun.aws.json file. We are planning to incorporate a few OAuth2.0 options for register/login, so I started the setup to add Sign in with Apple to the project by adding the required script to the index.html file & setting up the project on Apple Developer Portal. I also Completed 3 @Edabit JS challenges. 

**Thoughts**: Can't complete the Apple OAuth until we have a domain setup for the project.

**Code**: 

### Day 19: September 6, 2020

**Working On**:   Edabit.com challenges,  JS30 - Day 4-6?

**Today's Progress**: So I've been doing some of the easier @edabit challenges this week because I've wanted to push myself to work on refactoring my code.  One of today's challenges was to convert minutes to seconds (super easy I know), but rather than writing it out & then refactoring it, I was able to write it refactored right off the bat!  I'm trying to strengthen my basic JS skills. So this made me do a little chair dance!


Complete Day 4 of JS30 - Array Cardio Day 1!  Worked with .filter, .map, .sort, and .reduce. I hadn't much worked with some of these, so it was great to see different examples of how you might use them!

Completed Day 5 of JS30 - Flex Panel Image Gallery - this was a great refreshers in how to use JS with CSS Flexbox.  I haven't used Flexbox much, but it's always great to be reminded how easy it makes adding transitions.

Also worked some on the multi-docker project to clean it up some. Resolved the Travis CI issue.

### Day 20: September 7, 2020

**Working On**:    Edabit.com challenges, JS30 Day 6-7, Udemy.com - Kubernetes, Prentus project - peer coding for recipe schema.

**Today's Progress**: Started Kubernetes section of Udemy course. Went thru the installation process and beginning setup. I wasn't really sure what Kubernetes was so the 1st vid was very helpful.  It explained what Kubernetes was & why we would want to use it! It definetely makes since to use it with Docker so that you have more control when scaling up your project(s).

I meet with @Jyoti & @Liang from my @Prentus project to do some peer coding for one of our DB schema. We are using TDD for this project, so we got some great debugging going on before writing the schema.

Also completed a few more @Edabit challenages today.

### Day 24: September 11, 2020

**Working On**:    React

**Today's Progress**: I dove back into React by completed 70% of a Intro React Training course on Udemy. :tada: I haven't used React very much nor recently, so I thougth this would be a great refresher. :thought_balloon: It has been great for the very bascis of React.  Unfortunately it doesn't really address the issue(s) I'm currently stuck on regarding my portfolio. :confused: So I'll finish the course because I hate to leave anything undone then continue working thru my portfolio. :wink:

:bangbanb: A BIG thank you to @Mark for helping me work thru a Material-UI issue!!! :pray:  I've got to do a deep dive on Material UI so I can really understand how to fully use this powerful source. I made great progress on the portfolio and feel much more confident in what I will be launching on my domain later in the month. :calendar:

### Day 28: September 15, 2020

**Working On**:    Prentus project - Peer coding recipe scheme w/ TDD testing, Docker & AWS configuration, working on routes, 

**Today's Progress**: Today,I attended Red Hat Developer: DevNation Day!  The morning sessions were a little above my head as I'm just now learning Kubernetes, but it was great to hear some of the possibilites of Kubernetes.  In the afternoon I joined the JS sessions. I really enjoyed them & learned a lot!  It was amazing to see some of the different ways JS can be used when you are thinking outside of the box. Some of them had me taking note & others had me laughing out loud. Thanks @RedHatDeveloper for hosting a great virtual conference!

After DevNation Day, I join my @Prentus group for our weekly meeting.  @Ashely, our Designer, is killing it!!!!  The Devs (@Mark, @Jyoti, @Liang, @Melvin) and I meet to do some peer coding.  As previously stated we are doing Test Driven Development (TDD) on this project, so it was wonderful to get DB schema testing & model written.  Thanks @Liang for taking the lead today on this!  It is amazing getting to work with this team and I know I am learning so much from them all!!!

After dinner, I attended a wonderful startup meeting hosted by @Jae with #MentorMesh.

### Day 30: September 17, 2020

**Working On**:    LinkedIn Profile - Prentus project - Docker issue

**Today's Progress**: I had a wonderful conversation with @Jae Taylor regarding my career path.  He shed some wonderful insights and recommended due to my background that I do some research on Technical Program Managers.  He reminded me that there are so many other options inwhich developing (coding) is still a part of, but may play to more of my background strengths. I think in someways I had fallen into the trap that many new devs do of only thinking about landing a developer job, but there are many options in the development process. After our converstation, I felt really motovated & excited for the future!   

I spent the evening working with @Mark on the @Prentus group 2 project continuing to debug a few #c6Docker issues that we were encountering.  I'm thrilled to say that we got the main issues resolved.  Just left with 1 upstream (502) issue to resolve today.  Thanks @Mark for taking this journey into Docker/Kubernetes with me!

### Day 34: September 21, 2020

**Working On**:    React (udemy course), TPM Path (LinkedIn Learning), JS30 

**Today's Progress**: Completed a basic React course on Udemy.com. Started a LinkedIn Learning Career Path for TPM. 

**Thoughts**: Completed a basic #React course on @Udemy that I started a long time ago & just never finished.  It was a good refresher into the basics of React. No Hooks, No Material UI, just how to manually setup a React app. Mainly finished it today, because I hate leaving things undone & was wanting something quick to finish today. 

Also started a LinkedIn Learning Career Path for becoming a Software Program Manager.  The 1st part of this course is on #Agile Foundations. I'm just starting to study the Agile Methodology, but found it interesting that in the @Prentus group project that I'm the PM for, we were already using some of the principles without realizing it.  Going to try to implement sprints into the project with the team later today. I'm really excited to see what we create & I think this will really help! 

**Code**: Repo - [React-docker] (https://github.com/BETH-A/docker-react) 

### Day 35: September 22, 2020

**Working On**:    LinkedIn Profile, Portfolio, Prentus Team Meeting, MM Ventures meeting, Prentus Pair Coding

**Today's Progress**: Reflecting back on what I did today it seems that I was working on a little bit of everything.  Started the morning out working on my LinkedIn profile & portfolio.  In the afternoon/evening was mainly meetings.  

Meet with my @Prentus Group 2 team and we got a lot done in under an hour! I'm happy to say that we offically have a name for the project, Come to the Table! We are implementing sprints into our project both on design & development.  In our 1st 2 week sprint, we are going to focus on the landing page & the registration/login modals along with email verification. We will also be making solidifying the brand so that we can render our 1st sprint at the end of the 2 weeks. This is going to be new for us, but we are excited to put this into effect. So keep an eye out as I will be sharing tidbits along the way.

After dinner, I attended a Mentor Mesh Ventures meeting where we discussed startup concepts/ideas.  I'm very excited to be a part of this!  It will be an amazing learning experience!

You might ask, ok so where is the coding as this is part of #100daysofcode.  So at 10pm, I finally got to coding.  @Mark & I are pairing up on the Landing Page, so we meet & got started setting it up.  Really looking forward to setting this up & being able to show you all!

### Day 36: September 23, 2020

**Working On**:    CttT - work on Hero section of Landing Page, 

**Today's Progress**: Day 36 of #100daysofcode, I got started on the Landing Page Hero Section for our @Prentus project, Come to the Table. @Mark & I are using the VSC extention Live Share to collaborate on the Landing Page.  It's really cool that we can share the localhost server so that we can both see the live changes we are each making as we go. We also had a brief debugging session with some of the team regarding #docker.  Mark & I have a pretty good understand of the basics and are sharing that knowledge with the team (now that we kinda know what we are doing). The team is keeping us on our toes with new questions about Docker that we haven't looked at yet, so it's pushing us to dive deeper into how Docker works w/ the API routes, testing, etc. I love this!

### Day 37: September 24, 2020

**Working On**:    CttT - Finished Hero section of Landing Page

**Today's Progress**: Today, I  spent the day working on my @Prentus project, Come to the Table.  I finished the Landing Page Hero Section. Had a few debugging sessions with different members of the team, several conversations about Docker containers & how they work, and we had our 2nd Round Table (standup).  Since starting Sprint 1 of our project this week, there is a noticable energy & excitement from the team! 

I also did some market research on the Mentor Mesh Ventures startups that we are exploring. Very excited to be collaborating with so many wonderful people!
