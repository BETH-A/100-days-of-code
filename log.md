# 100 Days Of Code - Beth's Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2020

**Intentions**: Prioritize what all I need to work on to update portfolio and to move my projects to AWS.

**Skills I would like to strengthen**:
    React, Express, Swift, MongoDB, SwiftUI, SASS

**Would like to learn**:
    Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, UI/UX Design, Figma

**Today's Progress**: Setup training calendar. Identified areas I want to work on.

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to tackle this challenge & see where I'm at in 100 days!

### Day 1: August 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: My plan is to work on an old project that is currently broke due to npm issues.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with time management today.  Due to 'Life' occurring... my coding schedule was majorly interupted.  I did get to do some peer coding with the Dev group for a project I'm currently working on.  We were working on setting up the MongoDB User Schema.

### Day 2: August 20, 2020

**Working On**: I've recently started learning how to link AWS to GitHub & Docker.  

**Today's Progress**: Got GitHub > Docker > AWS to work once & then kept on getting errors.  So spent the night trying to debug.  Will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: AWS is interesting & very complex.  I need to know more about Docker to see if I'm having errors there.

### Day 3: August 21, 2020

**Working On**: Continued working on getting the bugs revolved between AWS to GitHub & Docker.  

**Today's Progress**: Feel like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.  Thinking I need to incorpate a CI inbetween GitHub & Docker/AWS.  Will look into that tomorrow.

**Thoughts** More confused than ever regarding the error I'm getting.  Think I'll check out Stephen Grinder's Udemy course tomorrow to see if that helps.

### Day 4: August 22, 2020

**Working On**: Stephen Grinder's Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy.    

**Today's Progress**: Got thru 1/4 of the course. Created a simple Node app as part of the course & connected it to Docker.

**Thoughts**: Have a much better understanding of Docker & how containers & images work.

### Day 5: August 23, 2020

**Working On**: Stephen Grinder's Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy.    

**Today's Progress**: 45% of the course done. Created a simple React app that was connected to Docker & deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The app used Travis CI to test & monitor the master GitHub branch before deploying to AWS.

**Thoughts**: I didn't get as much done today.  It was great to be able to create the full workflow.  Taking the project from basic React app to GitHub repo, then linking it to Docker. Followed by setting up Travis CI and the deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I look forward to the next Section where I'll be building a Multi-Container app.
